Specifically, the worst texture (0.2173) plays a significant role, followed by the worst concave points (0.1594), worst area (0.1341), area error (0.1116), and worst concavity (0.0949). These factors, related to the tumor's texture, shape, and size, collectively drive the model's prediction, highlighting the importance of irregularities in texture and the tumor's overall characteristics."
XGBoost_lime_self_consistency_7,XGBoost,lime,self_consistency,"The prediction of 0 is primarily driven by several contradictory factors, including worst concave points, worst texture, and worst concavity, which all have a negative impact. These factors, particularly worst concave points, seem to dominate the prediction. A minor positive influence comes from a small area error, but it is outweighed by the negative contributions. The combination of these factors results in the predicted outcome, highlighting the significance of concave points, texture irregularities, and area in this model."
XGBoost_lime_self_consistency_8,XGBoost,lime,self_consistency,"The prediction of 1 is primarily driven by several key factors related to the worst-case measurements of the data characteristics. Specifically, the worst texture, worst area, area error, worst radius, and worst concavity all contribute to this prediction, with the worst texture, worst area, and worst radius having significant influence. These factors, which include measures of irregularity and potential abnormalities, collectively support the prediction, suggesting that the data point exhibits several undesirable characteristics. The combination of these factors indicates that irregularities in texture, area, and shape are driving the model's result."
XGBoost_lime_self_consistency_9,XGBoost,lime,self_consistency,"The prediction of 0 is primarily driven by tumor characteristics that contradict the expected outcome. The top contributing factors, as identified by LIME, include worst concave points, worst area, worst radius, area error, and worst concavity, all of which have a negative impact on the prediction. These factors, particularly worst concave points, suggest that irregularities in tumor shape and size, typical of malignant tumors, are likely driving the prediction. The collective influence of these contradictory factors leads to the predicted outcome of 0, implying that tumors with such characteristics are less likely to receive a positive prediction."
